Welcome Partclone

Partclone is a project similar to the well-known backup utility "Partition Image" a.k.a partimage. Partclone provides utilities to back up and restore used-blocks of a partition and it is designed for higher compatibility of the file system by using existing library, e.g. e2fslibs is used to read and write the ext2 partition.

Partclone supports ext2, ext3, ext4, hfs+, reiser3.5, reiser3.6, and reiser4. We plan to develop zfs and jfs file system. We made some utilies:

    * partclone.ext2, partclone.ext3, and partclone.extfs
    * partclone.ext4 (need e2fsprogs-1.41.3 or higher version)
    * partclone.reiserfs
    * partclone.reiser4
    * partclone.xfs
    * partclone.fat
    * partclone.hfsp
    * partclone.ntfs
    * partclone.ntfsreloc
    * partclone.info 

We will use some libraries to get bitmap which provide waht block is used. like:

    * e2fsprogs support ext2, ext3, ext4!
    * HFS Plus Volume Format support hfsplus (build-in)
    * Reiser4 support reiser4
    * ReiserFS support reiserFS
    * XFS support xfs
    * ntfsprogs support ntfs
